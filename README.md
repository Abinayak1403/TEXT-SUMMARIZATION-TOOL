# 📝 Task 1 – Text Summarization using NLP

This project is part of my **CodTech AI Internship**.  
The goal is to build a Python-based tool that summarizes lengthy text using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

---

## 📌 Objective

To develop a simple, accurate text summarizer that:
- Accepts user input or file input
- Uses a pre-trained NLP model
- Returns a concise summary

---

## 🚀 How It Works

This project uses the `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model from Hugging Face's `transformers` library.

### ✅ Key Features:
- Accepts pasted input from the user
- Summarizes articles or long paragraphs
- Returns a shortened version that keeps key points
- Shows word count before/after summarization

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install the necessary Python libraries before running:

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

---

## 🧠 How to Run

1. Open terminal or VS Code
2. Run the script:

```bash
python text_summarizer.py
```

3. Paste or type your article
4. Press **Enter twice** to summarize

## 🧪 Example

### 📥 Input:

```
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the world across industries. From self-driving cars to personalized medicine...
```

### ✂️ Output:

```
AI is transforming industries by automating tasks and analyzing data...
```
